Testing out some comic formats. This is a 4-koma for those who are unfamiliar. Your average american newspaper runs its
comics from left to right horizontally in roughly 3 panels. In Japan, comics run vertically, top to bottom, and take
4 panels to execute the joke. It gives some leeway to dramatic pauses but ultimately the same joke could come across
in 3 panels. I'm not committing to it just yet, I just noticed my first picture is enormous and I need to find a solution.
I certainly read 75% of my comics on my phone and should assume others are probably doing the same.
