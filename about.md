Wedge and Hope is a spin off of sorts. They're proxy characters for my wife and I, though they were created before we new each other existed for a different comic. Somewhere between work and several children, I haven't had the dedication to finishing Wedge and Hope's story. That's where this comic comes in.

While I lack some story arcs to build, I do have infinite short stories with my family. Wedge and Hope will be filled with accurate to exaggerated events in my life that I feel are worth sharing.

Now to find time to draw it...
